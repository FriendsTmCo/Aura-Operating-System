## Contribute
You want to add awesome features to Aura? Here's how:

- Fork Aura-Operating-System repo
- Commit & push a new feature to the forked repository
- Open a pull request from your fork to Aura OS repository
- We will review and merge it :)

## Try Aura
Download VMWare [at this address](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0). Install and run it.

Now click on "Create a new virtual machine", select the iso file downloaded on [this page](https://github.com/aura-systems/Aura-Operating-System/releases) and click the "Next" button.

Now click on "Other" for "Guest operating system" and "Other" for version, click "Next" again, select "Store virtual disk as a single file" and select "Finish". 

The Virtual File System won't work so go to "C:\Users\username\Documents\Virtual Machines\Other" and replace the "Other.vmdk" by [this file](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/raw/master/Build/VMWare/Workstation/Filesystem.vmdk).

Now you can select Aura (Other) and click on "Play Virtual Machine".
